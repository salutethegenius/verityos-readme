# VerityOS – Sovereign AI Operating System 🧠⚡

> **Your AI. Your Rules.**  
> VerityOS is a modular, agent-based operating system designed to bring sovereign AI autonomy to small businesses, creators, NGOs, and emerging nations. It runs offline, adapts to your workflow, and never sells your data. Powered by purpose, not hype.

## 🌐 What Is VerityOS?

VerityOS is a task-execution AI system built around:
- **Local-first models** (Mistral, DeepSeek, etc.)
- **Smart memory + hybrid RAG**
- **Modular agents** (like Verity, Right, Nova, Ripple)
- **No cloud required** (unless you want it)
- **Custom hardware support** via VerityLite

Designed to operate like a human team with role-specific AI agents working together.
